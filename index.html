        <p>My passion for coding began during a Cyber Defense
          Certificate Program that I completed with the University of
          Central Florida in 2021. We studied a wide variety of topics
          that included Network Security, Ethical Hacking, and
          Game Theory. However, there was one topic that
          we covered where I found myself constantly studying and
          working outside of class. Python. I wasn't pouring myself into
          this subject because I felt as if I had some vast misunderstanding
          of it. No. I was simply having too much fun.
          <br>
          <br>
          <!-- Can elaborate more here once I have progressed further. For
          example, what topics have we learned? What would I consider myself
          fluent in? Am I specializing in front end, back end, or full
          stack? -->
          Therefore, I went back to my University and enrolled in their
          Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp.
          <br>
          <br>
          However, my life isn't all screens and technology! I also enjoy playing
          video games <span class="italic">(I know...)</span>,
          writing and recording music, and laying back while sipping on a coke and
          watching the latest and greatest TV show. <span class="italic">(Ok, I was wrong.
            I love technology)</span>!
          <br>
          <br>
          I am happily married to my gorgeous wife, Willa-Ann. We have two precious little
          boys that we love with all our heart. When I'm not typing away at my
          computer or playing music you'd catch me snuggling with one of them.
          <br>
          <br>
          I am excited to share this passion of mine and am looking forward
          to hearing from you!
