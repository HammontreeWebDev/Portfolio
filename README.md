## User Story
AS AN employer\
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples\
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
## Acceptance Criteria
Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring managerâ€™s needs:\
<br>
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work\
<br>
WHEN I load their portfolio\
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them\
<br>
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation\
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section\
<br>
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work\
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications\
<br>
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application\
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others\
<br>
WHEN I click on the images of the applications\
THEN I am taken to that deployed application\
<br>
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices\
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
